# The Odin Project
## Custom To-do list 

*todoify* is a customizable to-do app that goes beyond checklists. it syncs your tasks and projects with music from your spotify playlist that matches your mood, energy, or focus level.

### To be added (Hopefully):

- Integrate with Spotify web api 
- Link a specific song with a task/project depending on urgency
- Embed a spotify player
